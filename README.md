My personnal cheet sheet for the OCA and OCP java8 certifications

During my preparation for the OCA/OCP java8 certifications I choose the following books:

OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer II Study Guide
By Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff
Editor Sybex (A Wiley brand)
I strongly recommended aas it is a good book not only for the exam but for your java reference.
