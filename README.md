# OCA_OCP_java8
My personal cheet sheet for the OCA and OCP java8 certifications.

## Description
My intention with this git repository is backup in guithub my cheet sheets for the preparation of the certification. 

All the files are for personal use, but it can be viewed for if them can help any body else.

When I read a tech book, I used to undeline certain paragraphs to be reviewed after. What I have done is created a Java project with a package for every book chapter, and a some java classes with the paragraphs as comments and source java code describing the functionallities. 

The paragraph and code are a copy/paste from the pdf books.

With these you can review the book faster.
## Reference books
During my preparation for the OCA/OCP java8 certifications I choose the following books:
* OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I. Certification Guide. Exam 1Z0-803
  
  By Mala Gupta
  
  Editor Manning
  
  I strongly recommend it.

  
* OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer II Study Guide. Exam 1Z0-809

  By Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff
  
  Editor Sybex (A Wiley brand)
  
  I strongly recommend it. In my opinion it is a good book not only for the exam but for your java reference.
