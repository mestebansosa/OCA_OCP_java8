	 static variables can be useful for performing complex, multi-threaded tasks! 
	 TASKS and their relationships to threads: a task is a single unit of work performed by a thread. 
	 a task will commonly be implemented as a lambda expression. 
	 A thread can complete multiple independent tasks but only one task at a time.

		 diff between extending the Thread class and implementing Runnable:
         - If you need to define your own Thread rules upon which multiple tasks will rely, 
           such as a priority Thread, extending Thread may be preferable.
         - Since Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, better implement Runnable
         - Implementing Runnable is often a better object-oriented design practice since it separates
           the task being performed from the Thread object performing it.
         - Implementing Runnable allows the class to be used by numerous Concurrency API classes.
